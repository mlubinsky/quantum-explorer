# Changelog

All notable changes to quantum-explorer are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2026.0509i] — 2026-05-09

### Fixed
- **GitHub Actions deploy: second round of TypeScript errors** — removed two unused variables:
  - `matrixElements.test.ts`: `hoEnergies` → `_hoEnergies`
  - `tunnelling.test.ts`: `k` → `_k`

## [0.2026.0509h] — 2026-05-09

### Fixed
- **GitHub Actions deploy blocked by 10 TypeScript errors** — all resolved:
  - Removed unused imports: `hoSqueezedSigmaX` (TimeEvolutionExplorer),
    `hoEigenstate` (StationaryExplorer), `iswEigenstate` (EnergyLevelsDiagram),
    `InlineMath` (HydrogenExplorer), `fpExpectX` (FreeParticleExplorer)
  - `FreeParticleExplorer`: `useRef<number>()` → `useRef<number|undefined>(undefined)`;
    React 19 requires an explicit initial value to return a `MutableRefObject`
    (the no-arg overload returns a read-only `RefObject`, causing assignment errors)
  - `RingExplorer`: renamed unused `EnergyDiagram` prop `n: selectedN` → `n: _n`;
    added explicit type `{ points?: Array<{ x?: unknown }> }` to Plotly `onClick`
    parameter `e` to satisfy `noImplicitAny`

## [0.2026.0509g] — 2026-05-09

### Changed
- **TODO.md enriched with new feature proposals** — reviewed `TODO_new.md` and merged
  non-duplicate, analytically-feasible ideas into the roadmap. Added:
  - ISW cat-state / traveling-packet presets
  - WKB overlay for Scattering module
  - Phase 2: Heisenberg picture expansions (animated A_H(t), Ehrenfest panel,
    ladder operators, commutator display)
  - Phase 2: Extended entanglement module (Schmidt decomp, concurrence, partial trace)
  - Phase 2: Two-particle ISW symmetrization (bosons/fermions, Pauli exclusion)
  - Phase 2: Interactive Fourier Explorer (exact for Gaussians)
  - Phase 2: Position-space wavefunction collapse (detector click, re-normalise)
  - Phase 2: Wigner function (exact Gaussian form for coherent/squeezed/Fock)
  - Phase 2 Hydrogen: Normal Zeeman (detailed), Anomalous Zeeman, Stark effect (linear)
  - Phase 3: Density matrix + decoherence (Kraus channels, purity, entropy)
  - Phase 3: Adiabatic theorem / Landau-Zener (exact LZ formula)
  - Phase 3: URL state encoding, Comparison mode
  - Excluded section extended with explicit rationale for double-slit, 2D solver,
    path integral, large many-body, and Paschen-Back as out-of-scope items

## [0.2026.0509f] — 2026-05-09

### Fixed
- **Ring wavepacket animation frozen on Play** — `coeffs` and `thetas` were plain
  `const` array assignments inside the component, so every `setFrame`/`setDisplayT`
  state update produced new array references, causing `getFrame` and `tick`
  `useCallback`s to be recreated each frame. This triggered `useEffect([running, tick])`
  on every render, which cancelled and restarted the `requestAnimationFrame` loop and
  reset `lastTimeRef.current = null`, making `dt = 0` on every tick and leaving `t`
  permanently at 0. Fixed by wrapping `coeffs` in `useMemo([n0])` and `thetas` in
  `useMemo([])` so both have stable references across renders.

## [0.2026.0509e] — 2026-05-09

### Fixed
- **`angularShape` m<0 mislabelled as xz cross-section** — the polar plot showed
  `∫|Y_lm|²dφ/(2π)`, the φ-integrated θ-profile, which is identical for m and −m.
  The old annotation "θ-profile only — φ-orientation not shown" did not warn that
  for m<0 real spherical harmonics (sin(|m|φ) factor) the xz-plane density is
  identically zero — the lobes live in the yz-plane. Fixed:
  - Plot title changed to `∫|Y_lm|²dφ — φ-integrated θ-profile`.
  - Persistent note: "Same shape for m and −m; φ-factor (cos vs sin) not shown."
  - When m<0: amber warning annotation "m<0 (sin(|m|φ) factor): xz-plane density
    is zero — lobes live in yz-plane."
  - Help modal rewrote `AngularShapeSection` to explain the φ-factor, why m and −m
    look identical in this plot, and which plane each orbital's lobes inhabit.
  - `angularShape` docstring updated to state the φ-integration explicitly.

## [0.2026.0509d] — 2026-05-09

### Fixed
- **`groundStateN` silent branch at half-integer φ** — at level crossings
  (`φ = k + 0.5`) two bands are exactly degenerate and `Math.round` silently
  picked one. Added `isDegenerateGS(phi, eps=0.005)` and `degenerateGSPair(phi)`
  to `ring.ts`. In the UI:
  - Energy diagram: both degenerate bands drawn at full width (3 px) with star
    markers and a labelled callout arrow `"degenerate n=k, k+1"`.
  - Readout panel: `n*(φ)` row shows `k, k+1 (degenerate)` in amber instead of a
    single silent integer.
  9 new unit tests for `isDegenerateGS` and `degenerateGSPair`; test count 301 → 310.

## [0.2026.0509c] — 2026-05-09

### Fixed
- **`iswExpectX2` replaced 400-point quadrature with exact analytical formula** —
  previously ⟨x²(t)⟩ was computed by summing `x²|ψ(x,t)|²` on a 400-point grid,
  which had O(10⁻⁴) error and was O(N_grid × N_coeffs²) in cost. It is now
  computed as the exact double sum `Σ_{m,n} c_m c_n cos((E_m−E_n)t) X2_{mn}`
  where the matrix elements are:
  - diagonal: `X2_{nn} = L²/3 − L²/(2n²π²)`
  - off-diagonal: `X2_{mn} = 2L²(−1)^{m+n}/π² · [1/(m−n)² − 1/(m+n)²]`
  derived by integrating `x² sin(mπx/L) sin(nπx/L)` in closed form. The result
  matches quadrature to 4 decimal places and is exact to machine precision.
  5 new unit tests: diagonal values, time-independence of eigenstates, agreement
  with quadrature for ground state and 1+2 mix at T_rev/4.

## [0.2026.0509b] — 2026-05-09

### Added
- **HO coherent and squeezed state Re(ψ)/Im(ψ)** — implemented exact complex
  wavefunctions for both sub-modes. For the coherent state:
  `ψ_α(x,t) = (ω/π)^{1/4} exp(−ωξ²/2) · exp(i·phase)`,
  `phase = p_cl·ξ + p_cl·⟨x⟩/2 − ωt/2`. For the squeezed state the same carrier
  phase gains a quadratic chirp term `−χ(t)·ξ²` where
  `χ(t) = sinh(2r)·sin(2ωt) / (2σ_x²(t))`, derived from the Riccati equation.
  Both satisfy `Re² + Im² = |ψ|²` exactly (8 new unit tests verify this pointwise
  and via numerical norm). The Re/Im display toggle in the UI now works for all
  three sub-modes (ISW, HO Coherent, HO Squeezed).

## [0.2026.0509a] — 2026-05-09

### Fixed
- **ISW momentum amplitude: wrong phase at k = −kₙ pole (bug)** — `iswMomentumAmplitude`
  resolved both poles to `−i·√(L/4π)`, but the L'Hôpital limit at `k = −kₙ` is
  `+i·√(L/4π)`. The incorrect sign had no effect on the static `|φₙ(k)|²` plot (the
  magnitude is the same) but caused wrong interference in `iswMomentumProbTE` at the
  negative-momentum peaks. Fixed by branching on `k ≥ 0`. Added 3 new tests for
  pole phases and magnitudes.

- **`wkbT` returned 1 for E ≥ V₀ (wrong physics)** — WKB tunnelling is undefined
  above the barrier (no evanescent region). The function now returns `NaN` for
  `E ≥ V₀`; the UI readout was already guarded by `{E < V₀ && ...}` so no UI
  change. Added 2 tests confirming NaN for `E = V₀` and `E > V₀`.

- **`scatteringPsiSq` at E = V₀ returned a constant (wrong physics)** — the `E ≈ V₀`
  branch returned `transmissionT(...)` (a single number) as the inside density, but
  the true TISE solution at `E = V₀` is linear: `ψ_B = A + Bx`. The branch now
  derives `A` and `B` by matching the exact boundary conditions at `x = +L/2` and
  evaluates `|A + Bx|²`. `scatteringAmplitudes` was also updated for `E = V₀`: it
  now uses the exact linear transfer-matrix result `t = 2e^{−ikL}/(2−ikL)` and
  `r = −ikL·e^{−ikL}/(2−ikL)` instead of the incorrect zero-imaginary-part
  approximation. Added 2 continuity tests for the `E = V₀` wavefunction.

- **`persistentCurrent` was off by 2π (unit error)** — the function returned
  `−∂E/∂φ = (n−φ)/R²`, which is the φ-derivative, not the physical persistent
  current `I = −∂E/∂Φ = (n−φ)/(2πR²)` (where `Φ₀ = 2π` in atomic units). Divided
  by `2π` to match the textbook definition. Updated 4 ring unit tests to the
  corrected values; the derivative identity test now verifies against `−dE/dΦ`.

## [0.2026.0508h] — 2026-05-08

### Added
- **Module equation strip** — a compact two-line strip now appears between the
  navigation buttons and the module content, showing the governing equation and either
  boundary conditions or key results for each module:
  - Stationary States: `Ĥψ=Eψ` + ISW/HO boundary conditions
  - Time Evolution: `i∂ψ/∂t=Ĥψ` + superposition formula
  - Free Particle: TDSE with V=0 + vg, vφ, σ(t)
  - Scattering: TISE with step potential + asymptotic scattering BCs
  - Spin-½: Larmor Hamiltonian + Bloch vector normalisation
  - Hydrogen: `Ĥψ=Eψ` with Coulomb potential + En and asymptotic BCs
  - Ring & A-B: Hamiltonian with flux + Aharonov-Bohm phase BC

### Removed
- Subtitle "Exact analytical quantum mechanics — no backend, no numerical eigensolvers"
  (replaced by the equation strip which conveys the same intent more concretely)
- Duplicate Schrödinger equation block from Free Particle left control panel
- Duplicate Schrödinger equation row from Hydrogen Atom header

## [0.2026.0508g] — 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- **Re(ψ)/Im(ψ) used approximate phase (bug)** — `fpRePsi`/`fpImPsi` omitted the
  quadratic chirp term ξ²t/(8σ₀²σ(t)²) and the Gouy phase −arctan(t/t₀)/2 that arise
  as the packet spreads. Both functions are now exact. The chirp makes the oscillation
  pattern tighter on the leading edge and wider on the trailing edge at large t; ignoring
  it gave visually wrong fringes for t ≳ t₀. Functions moved to `freeParticle.ts` and
  exported so they can be unit-tested.
- **x-grid too narrow for negative k₀ (bug)** — `makeProbGrid` only extended the grid
  to the right regardless of the sign of k₀. For k₀ < 0 the packet moved off the left
  edge. Fixed by computing both endpoints c₀ = x₀ and c₁ = x₀+k₀·t_max and spanning
  min(c₀,c₁)−4σ_f … max(c₀,c₁)+4σ_f.
- **Changing x₀ or k₀ did not reset time/history (bug)** — the reset `useEffect`
  depended only on `sigma0`; changing x₀ or k₀ while playing left stale history in the
  expectation-value plots. Added x₀ and k₀ to the dependency array.
- **History appended on every render (bug)** — the history push `useEffect` had no
  dependency array, so it fired on every re-render (opening help modal, toggling a
  section, etc.), duplicating points. Added `[t, expectX, deltaX, uxp]` as dependencies.

### Improved
- **"Norm history" section renamed to "Analytic norm = 1"** — the chart always shows
  the flat line 1.0 because this is an analytic guarantee, not a computed quantity. The
  old label "Norm history" implied a numerical check was being performed.

### Added
- 5 new tests for `fpRePsi`/`fpImPsi`: Re²+Im²=|ψ|² identity at t=0 and t>>0, correct
  phase at t=0, chirp is detectable at t=t₀, norm integral via Re/Im. Tests 277–281.

## [0.2026.0508f] — 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- **Scattering reflection amplitude phase (bug)** — `scatteringAmplitudes()` computed the
  complex reflection amplitude r with an incorrect phase in both the oscillatory (E > V0)
  and evanescent (E < V0) cases. The old code computed a rough angle then rescaled the
  magnitude, producing the right |r| but wrong arg(r), which made the standing-wave
  interference pattern on the incident side appear at wrong positions. Fixed using the
  exact transfer-matrix formula r = −i·rFactor·t (oscillatory: rFactor = (k²−κ²)/(2kκ)·sin(κL);
  evanescent: rfFactor = (k²+κ̃²)/(2kκ̃)·sinh(κ̃L)). This satisfies |r|²+|t|²=1
  algebraically, eliminating the rescaling step entirely. The wavefunction is now exactly
  continuous at both barrier boundaries.
- **E ≈ V0 limiting formula (cosmetic)** — `transmissionT` near-threshold branch used
  1/(1 + V0²L²/(8E)) instead of the correct Taylor limit 1/(1 + V0²L²/(2E)). The
  threshold (|E−V0| < 1e-12) is too narrow to be triggered by UI sliders, but the
  formula is now correct.

### Added
- 8 new tests for `scatteringAmplitudes`: |r|²+|t|²=1 for oscillatory and evanescent
  cases, wavefunction continuity at both boundaries for both regimes, resonance condition
  r=0, and V0=0 free-particle check. Tests 269–276.

## [0.2026.0508e] — 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- **Bell simulation always returned identical results (bug)** — `simulatePairs` reset
  its LCG seed to a fixed constant on every call, so pressing "Run simulation" again
  gave exactly the same counts. Replaced with `Math.random()` (default) and added an
  optional `rng` parameter so tests can still use deterministic sequences.

### Added
- **Measurement axis shown on Bloch sphere** — `SternGerlachPanel` now fires an
  `onAxisChange` callback when the Stern-Gerlach axis changes. `SpinExplorer` stores
  it and passes it as `measureAxis` to `BlochSphere`, which renders it as the existing
  dashed yellow line. The axis only appears while on the Measurement tab.

### Improved (documentation / UI)
- **Precession sign convention documented** — `computeTrajectory` in `spinMath.ts` now
  has a comment explaining the counterclockwise convention (H = +½ω₀σ·B̂). The
  Spin help panel now includes a sign-convention note with the NMR/electron alternative.
- **Bell CHSH section**: added italic note that the four angles are coplanar analyzer
  settings and the 2√2 maximum is achievable in-plane.
- **Bell simulation section**: clarified that each run is independently random (now that
  the LCG is gone) so repeated clicks give different counts.

## [0.2026.0508d] — 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- **2D orbital origin bug (physics)** — `orbitalDensity2D` returned 0 at r=0 for all
  orbitals, including 1s where the density is maximum. Fixed by delegating to
  `orbitalDensity3D(n,l,m, x,0,z, Z)` which already handles the l=0 origin case.
- **2D orbital m-sign bug (physics)** — `orbitalDensity2D` used only `|m|` for the
  angular factor, making m=+1 and m=-1 look identical. Real spherical harmonics have
  a φ-factor: cos(|m|φ) for m>0, sin(|m|φ) for m<0. In the xz-plane (y=0, φ=0 or π),
  m<0 orbitals have zero density. Delegating to `orbitalDensity3D` at y=0 fixes both
  issues in one change.
- **Normalization comment typo** — `radialWavefunction` docstring said `((n+l)!)^3`
  (Griffiths-convention residue); the code uses the Abramowitz-Stegun convention where
  it should be `(n+l)!` to the first power. Comment corrected.

### Improved (UI)
- **2D heatmap**: added orange warning banner when m<0 (xz cross-section is blank);
  explains the orbital lies in a different plane. Heatmap title updated to say
  "xz cross-section (y = 0) — color normalized to peak".
- **Angular shape plot**: annotation updated from "Rotate around z-axis for 3D shape"
  to "θ-profile only — φ-orientation not shown for m ≠ 0".
- **Grotrian legend**: added disclaimer that same-n levels are degenerate in this
  nonrelativistic model; clarified that E1 selection rule shown is Δℓ = ±1 only
  (Δm not displayed).

### Tests
- 5 new `orbitalDensity2D` tests: non-zero origin for 1s, zero origin for 2p, m±1
  distinction, left-right symmetry for m=0, exact equality with orbitalDensity3D at y=0.
  Total: 268 tests.

## [0.2026.0508c] — 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- **Squeezed state Fock distribution wrong (physics bug)** — `decompData` for `ho-sq`
  was using the Poisson distribution (valid only for coherent states). Added
  `squeezedFockDist()` to `timeEvolution.ts` which numerically evaluates
  `P(n) = |⟨n|ψ_sq(t=0)⟩|²` by grid integration; `TimeEvolutionExplorer` now uses it
  for the HO Squeezed energy decomposition bar chart.
- **Re(ψ)/Im(ψ) display buttons visible for HO modes** — these modes only compute
  `|ψ|²`, not the complex wavefunction. Buttons now hidden when `subMode !== 'isw'`;
  switching to an HO mode resets `displayMode` to `'prob'`.
- **Squeezed state description misleading** — description said `S(r)|α⟩`; corrected
  to `D(α)S(r)|0⟩` to match what the code actually implements.
- **Expectation-value history stale after parameter change** — `histRef` accumulated
  entries from old parameter regimes. Added a reset `useEffect` that clears `histRef`
  whenever `subMode`, coefficients, `L`, `α`, `φ_α`, `ω`, or `r` change.
- **"Norm history" label misleading** — the plot shows the analytical constant 1, not
  a numerical norm check. Section header renamed to "Norm conservation".

### Tests
- 6 new `squeezedFockDist` tests: normalisation, Poisson limit (r=0), even-n-only for
  squeezed vacuum, ground-state purity, non-negativity. Total: 263 tests.

## [0.2026.0508b] — 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- **HO matrix elements wrong grid (severe)** — `StationaryExplorer` was passing
  `gridX = [0, L]` (ISW grid) to `MatrixPanel` for the harmonic oscillator, but HO
  wavefunctions live on `[−xMax, xMax]`. All HO X and P matrix elements were computed
  against incorrect x-coordinates. Fix: build a common symmetric grid from the widest
  eigenstate (n = N_LEVELS−1) and evaluate all HO wavefunctions via `hoWavefunction`.
- **P matrix Heisenberg animation wrong trig function** — `Re[P_mn(t)] = −Im[P_mn]·sin(ωmn·t)`,
  not `Im[P_mn]·cos(ωmn·t)`. Added `heisenbergReFromIm()` to `matrixElements.ts`;
  `MatrixPanel` now uses it for the P operator in animated view.
- **ISW momentum amplitude pole sign wrong for even n** — limit of φₙ(k→kₙ) is
  `−i·√(L/4π)` for all n; was returning `+i·√(L/4π)` for even n. Negligible visual
  impact (grid rarely hits exact pole), but now analytically correct.
- **Evanescent inside-barrier wavefunction discontinuity** — `insideCoeffsEvanescent`
  used `√T` as a real proxy for the complex transmission amplitude `t`, discarding its
  phase. Caused `|ψ_inside(L/2)|² = T·cos²(kL/2)` instead of `T`. Fixed by deriving
  complex A, B from the full complex `t`.
- **ParameterSlider integer values showed `.00`** — added `digits` prop (default 2);
  quantum number n, Z, and degree-angle sliders now pass `digits={0}`.
- **App subtitle** — changed "no approximations" to "no numerical eigensolvers" to
  accurately reflect that finite-difference derivatives and quadrature are used for
  visualization, but eigenvalues are always closed-form.

### Added
- **Spin-½ state presets** — six one-click buttons (|↑⟩ |↓⟩ |+x⟩ |−x⟩ |+y⟩ |−y⟩)

## [0.2026.0506c] — 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- **Expectation Values plot blank after collapse/expand** — replaced `<details>/<summary>`
  with state-controlled conditional rendering for all four collapsible plot sections
  (Energy decomposition, Expectation values, Momentum-space, Norm history). Plotly
  rendered with zero width inside `display:none` and never resized on re-open; remounting
  on show fixes this. Adds ▾/▸ triangles matching Free Particle style.
- **No disclosure triangle on Time Evolution collapsible plots** — `display:flex` on
  `<summary>` suppresses the browser `::marker` pseudo-element. Removed the flex
  properties; added `stopPropagation` on ? button spans to prevent accidental
  collapse when clicking help.
